This is our 3rd semester project. 
The system is a mobile app for assistance to students seeking admission to a college which is affliated to DTE's MCA Entrance 
Test in Maharashtra.
My contribution is towards DialogFlow, a Google based NLP chatbot system and towards writing Python scripts to scrap data from
the original DTE website.
