# DTE MCA Help
This is our 3rd semester Mobile Communications project. 
The system is a mobile app for assistance to students seeking admission to a college which is affliated to DTE's MCA Entrance 
Test in Maharashtra.
Project's most valuable feature and my contribution is towards DialogFlow, a Google based NLP chatbot system and towards writing Python scripts to scrap data from
the original DTE website.

## Using Dialog Flow
Dialogflow is a conversational UX platform enabling brand unique, natural language interactions for devices, applications, and services. In other words, Dialogflow is a framework which provides NLP / NLU (Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding) services. More than that, Dialogflow supplies one-click integration with most of the popular messaging platforms such as Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, Viber, Kik, etc. and also supports voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.
